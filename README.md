# Complex_Submarine
Visualizing complex functions from Euler's identity.
Can be set to become two different functions, where 
the x values are set to be real and y are imaginary.
Furthermore, the keybindings are illustrated and you
can increase or decrease many variables in real time, 
such as the result given an x 0.001 smaller or x1000.
Here is an example of outputs:
